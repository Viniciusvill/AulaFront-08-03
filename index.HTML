        </h1>
        <p>
            There ain't no gold in this river<br>
            That I've been washin' my hands in forever<br>
            I know there is hope in these waters<br>
            But I can't bring myself to swim<br>
            When I am drowning in this silence<br>
            Baby, let me in<br>
            <br>
            Go easy on me, baby<br>
            I was still a child<br>
            Didn't get the chance to<br>
            Feel the world around me<br>
            I had no time to choose<br>
            What I chose to do<br>
            So go easy on me<br>
            <br>
            There ain't no room for things to change<br>
            When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways<br>
            You can't deny how hard I've tried<br>
            I changed who I was to put you both first<br>
            But now I give up<br>
            <br>
            Go easy on me, baby<br>
            I was still a child<br>
            Didn't get the chance to<br>
            Feel the world around me<br>
            Had no time to choose<br>
            What I chose to do<br>
            So go easy on me<br>
            <br>
            I had good intentions<br>
            And the highest hopes<br>
            But I know right now<br>
            It probably doesn't even show<br>
            <br>
            Go easy on me, baby<br>
            I was still a child<br>
            I didn't get the chance to<br>
            Feel the world around me<br>
            I had no time to choose<br>
            What I chose to do<br>
            So go easy on me<br>
